Its important to me that this thing is kinda cools so I am thinking of some features I want it to have
- google calendar integration where it wakes me up 30 minutes before the first event on my calendar
- Gives me a preview of my day and everything I gotta do (all the stuff on my calendar)

Still thinking of some features but planning on writing those as I go

Haven't updated in a while but i finished my schematic so far and my pcb. The design is currently 4 different pcb modules which will all be connected by cables so I can create a "3d case." One module for the main board with the ESP32-s3-mini, another one for the snooze button, and 2 rotary encoders.

I am in a bit of a rush to get the invite to highway, but yeah.

The PCB has some errors and for some reason says I need to connect the ground even though there is a powerflag, but those are issues I feel fine ignoring lol.

I am starting to work on the case in fusion360.
