Wanted to note, I had no idea we had to write down the hours we worked on it so I just estimated the hours it took after the fact.

# June 26th
Its important to me that this thing is kinda cools so I am thinking of some features I want it to have
- google calendar integration where it wakes me up 30 minutes before the first event on my calendar
- Gives me a preview of my day and everything I gotta do (all the stuff on my calendar)

Still thinking of some features but planning on writing those as I go.

Picked out a couple of the parts I know I want to use like an esp32-s3-mini as the main board thing.

**Total time spent: 30min**

# June 29th
Haven't updated in a while but i finished my schematic so far and my pcb. The design is currently 4 different pcb modules which will all be connected by cables so I can create a "3d case." One module for the main board with the ESP32-s3-mini, another one for the snooze button, and 2 rotary encoders.

I am in a bit of a rush to get the invite to highway, but yeah.

The PCB has some errors and for some reason says I need to connect the ground even though there is a powerflag, but those are issues I feel fine ignoring lol.

I am starting to work on the case in fusion360.

**Total time spent: 3.5hrs**

# June 30th

I've been starting to work on the case and I realised that 2 ec11 encoders doesn't really make any sense and that the current structure makes the clock look werid lol.

I have to do some redesign to support the buzzer which will wake me up. Its going to be on the snooze bar and there will be 2 big of them.

I also made a mistake and accidentally deleted the correct copy of the pcb ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è so now I gotta redo some sizing changes and stuff.

Here is the before. As you can see the dial on the side is just too tall this is because I had 2 screws to secure it. Now it is only one with a hook at the top to make sure it doesn't moove and shake around.

Here it is now! I like the cases structure and how it looks ngl.

Some stuff I added are beepers to help me actually wake up they are placed on the snooze button (Not sure if you can see them but they are there)
After this, I have only the hard part which is just making the code!

**Total time spent: 4hrs**

# July 1st

I've just started finishing up my 3d modeling and stuff and now I am going to work on the firmware.

I am going to use circuit python just because I have the most experience with that

Some goals for today
- build out a beeper function
- properly display time
- schedule alarms properly
- maybe google calendar integration?? (this is kinda gunna be hard)

Ok now I finished all those and built everything besides the google calendar integration, but I think this is ready to submit?

Just finished my readme and added the BOM
