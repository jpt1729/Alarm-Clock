Its important to me that this thing is kinda cools so I am thinking of some features I want it to have
- google calendar integration where it wakes me up 30 minutes before the first event on my calendar
- Gives me a preview of my day and everything I gotta do (all the stuff on my calendar)

Still thinking of some features but planning on writing those as I go
